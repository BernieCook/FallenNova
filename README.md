#Fallen Nova
Fallen Nova is a personal [ASP.NET MVC 4](http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc4) solution which provides me with a sandbox within which I can
construct and extend a [DDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) solution that utilises an array of modern tools 
and frameworks from the Microsoft technology stack, as well as number of complimentary libraries, APIs and design patterns i.e.:

* [ASP.NET MVC 4] (http://www.asp.net/mvc)
* [Entity Framework 6] (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/data/ef.aspx)
* [Bootstrap] (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
* [BCrypt.Net] (http://bcrypt.codeplex.com/)
* [nUnit] (http://www.nunit.org/)
* .NET 4.5 claims based security
* Service, Repository, Unit of Work patterns...

This is still a work in progress, and I'm also trying out few different approaches to certain design patterns, so do excuse any 
TODOs or implementations of a given design pattern or framework which breaks a given [DDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) 
or [SOLID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design%29) design principle. 

Do feel free to fork, improve/modify, and send me a pull request if you have any suggestions.

##Setup
To get the solution up and running simply clone it then run the scripts in the "Solution Resources" folder. If you're having 
trouble getting the database working let me know and I'll send you an SQL backup.

If you want to re-run the T4 templates you'll need to ensure you've installed the "EF 5.x DbContext Fluent Generator for C#" 
via Visual Studio's Extensions and Updates tool, or grab the [Fluent Generator installer](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/5d663b99-ed3b-481d-b7bc-b947d2457e3c?SRC=VSIDE) from the official Visual Studio gallery page.

##Frameworks, Tools, Languages, etc.
Tools, frameworks and languages currently employed: AutoMapper, ASP.NET MVC 4, Bootstrap, BCrypt.Net, C#, .NET4.5 Claims Based Identity, 
ELMAH, Entity Framework, HTML 5, jQuery, glimpse, Modernizr, Ninject, nUnit, ReSharper, SQL 2008 R2, Web API and Visual Studio 2012.

##Note
As noted above this is still a work in progress so although it will compile and run there is still a lot of [sprinting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development%29#Sprint) to go.

Enjoy.
